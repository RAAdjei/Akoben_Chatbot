Attempt to commit a criminal offence
(1) A person who attempts to commit a criminal offence shall not be acquitted on the ground that the
criminal offence could not be committed according to the intent
(a)by reason of the imperfection or other condition of the means, or
(b)by reason of the circumstances under which they are used, or
(c)by reason of the circumstances affecting the person against whom, or the thing in respect of
which the criminal offence is intended to be committed, or
(d)by reason of the absence of that person or thing.
(2) A person who attempts to commit a criminal offence commits a criminal offence, and except as
otherwise provided in this Act, is liable to be convicted and punished as if the criminal offence has been
completed.
(3) Where an act amounts to a complete criminal offence, as defined by a provision of this Act, and is
also an attempt to commit any other criminal offence, a person who does the act commits a criminal
offence and is liable to be convicted and punished under either provision or under this section.
(4) A provision in this Act with respect to intent, exemption, justification, or extenuation, or any other
matter in the case of an act, shall apply with the necessary modifications to the case of an attempt to do
that act.
